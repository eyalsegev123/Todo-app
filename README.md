Todo App
Description
The Todo App is a full-stack web application that allows users to manage tasks efficiently. It features authentication, task creation, and management. The application is built with a Node.js backend and a React frontend, using MongoDB for data storage.

Features
User registration and login with secure JWT-based authentication.
CRUD operations for tasks.
Responsive user interface with Material-UI components.
